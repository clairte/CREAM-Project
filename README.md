# CREAM-Project

CREAM is a synthesizier that allows users to create, use, and save both available and user-created sounds. 
The synthesizer currently offers manipulations on adsr, filter, lfo, and reverb. 

The CREAM-Project aims to create a beginner-friendly synthesizer with limited parameters and a cream-like sound palette. 
Work in progress!
